 * Where the game's HUD is on screen, read from Panorama rather than guessed.

 * Every rectangle comes from the panel the game itself lays out, so resolution, HUD scale, a
 * flipped minimap, an extra-large minimap, a hero with six abilities or a courier with none all
 * report correctly with nothing to configure. A rectangle is undefined while the panel behind it
 * is gone or takes part in no layout — that is the signal to skip drawing, not a reason to fall
 * back on a guess.
 * @example
 * const inventory = GUIInfo.LowerHUD.MainInventorySlots[0]
 * if (inventory !== undefined) {
