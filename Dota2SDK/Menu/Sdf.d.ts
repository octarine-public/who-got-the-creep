	 *
	 * The quad is stretched around the surface it stands in, far enough for the halo and the room its

	 * itself would be bigger than it looks.

	 * halo inside its box. A surface that does clip lights itself instead: a quad of its own placed
	 * that far outside it, carved by {@link SdfShape} with the same glow.
