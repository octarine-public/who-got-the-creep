	 * not hold reads soft however well the chain was built; a source minted for that box is cut once,
	 * straight to it, and an element that only moved re-mints nothing.
	 *
	 * Sizes and radius are in screen pixels, not dp. Radius defaults to zero and is baked into
	 * raster artwork; the element keeps no second rounded clip. Sources that cannot be baked keep
	 * their radius on the element. An empty path clears the element. What the source was

	 * before it is cut is painted with nothing, or with a plain colour, and never asks again. So the

	 * nothing where it showed nothing: {@link SettleSizedArt} lands the copy at the end of the frame
	 * it is ready, whether or not the element is written again.
